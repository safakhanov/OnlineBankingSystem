            <p class="text-light">BlackRock, Inc. is an American multinational investment company based in New York
                City. Founded in 1988,
                initially as an enterprise risk management and fixed income institutional asset manager, BlackRock is
                the world's largest asset manager, with US$9.42 trillion in assets under management as of June 30,
                2023.[3] BlackRock operates globally with 70 offices in 30 countries, and clients in 100 countries.[1]
                BlackRock is the manager of the iShares group of exchange-traded funds, and along with The Vanguard
                Group and State Street, it is considered to be one of the Big Three index fund managers.[4][5] Its
                Aladdin software keeps track of investment portfolios for many major financial institutions and its
                BlackRock Solutions division provides financial risk management services.[6] BlackRock is ranked 184th
                on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[7]

                BlackRock has sought to position itself as an industry leader in environmental, social, and corporate
                governance (ESG). It has been criticized by some for investing in companies that are involved in fossil
                fuels, the arms industry, the People's Liberation Army and human rights violations in China & the
                backing of Israel's military. Others have scrutinized BlackRock for its efforts to reduce its
                investments in companies that have been accused of contributing to climate change and gun violence and
                its promotion of gender diversity; the U.S. states of West Virginia, Florida, and Louisiana have
                divested money away from or refuse to do business with the firm because of its ESG policies. The company
                has also faced criticism for its close ties with the Federal Reserve during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
